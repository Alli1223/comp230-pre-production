#Comp230 - Game Component Proposal

(possibly subject to change based on the BA game choice)

##Multiplayer component Proposal 

###What is the product?
The product I intend to make is a networking component that will make the BA game multiplayer.
This will allow players to play together over the internet or local network.

The component will consist of a online lobby system and an online matchmaking system.

###Is there a market? Who is the target audience?
There is currently a large market for online multiplayer games at the moment, as most of the new AAA titles feature some sort of multiplayer interaction. 

Also according to one article I found online, adding PVP multiplayer to your game could increase revenue by 510%.

The target Audience would be people who enjoy playing games with their friends online, or at LAN parties.

###What are the unique selling points?

* Could have some form of team combo mechanics, where the players can combine abilities.


###Is the scope appropriate for the product development time-frame?
I believe with using the unity engine and possibly some third-party software this will be achievable. 
Unity has a large amount of documentation on implementing a networking component into a game.
